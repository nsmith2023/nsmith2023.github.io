# trimesterTwoProject

Team Member Name: Nicholas SOLO

Company Name: Free Slots 2

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a site that can host multiple users and contains a free slot machine or free blackjack. This site is based off of the original free slots. I hope to be able to add several other games as well as the slot machine depending on time. These games could be blackjack, poker, or any other simple game. Each player should have credits to play the games and there will be a leaderboard featuring initials of players and their scores. There will also be background music.

Interactivity:
The player will be able to select the games that they are playing and also play them. With slots this is simply pressing a button, with other games user inputs may need to be more complex.

Develop In Stages
The first step will be to develop a simple slot machine, this will include animations as well as music with other js. Next a leaderboard will need to be added, which appears to be the most complex of the tasks. I will learn how to do this. Last, other games besides slots will need to be added as well as a menu to navigate them.

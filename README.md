Project Description
Keep it brief, but what are you creating? If you are recreating a game, briefly describe the features that you want to include and exclude. If you are modeling some physics or chemistry, what specifically are you modeling? If you are creating a data visualizer, what data sets are you looking at and what options (if any) will the user have? Some of your project's features might fall into an "if there's enough time" category; if this is the case, what are these stretch goals?

Interactivity
What kind of interactivity will the project have? Will the user be able to do something with the keyboard? If so, which keys map to which actions (give your best estimate for nowâ€¦it can change later if it needs to, but this is about planning ahead)? Will the user be able to do something with the mouse? If so, what do left/right mouse clicks do? Will the motion of the mouse do anything? You can be brief here; you only need to talk about the features you are implementing (e.g. you don't have to mention the mouse if your project is not using the mouse).

Develop In Stages
What are the first couple of features/elements/stages that you want to create? I really want to encourage you to map out and plan stages for your project. This should help you focus your work and make it easier for you to continuously test your code along the way. If you are working with others, then it should also help you dole out tasks to various team members. You don't need to list out all of the stages (please don't), but I want to know that you've thought about how you are going to start and what the immediate plan is. It is very tempting to start coding right away, but it is more important to think about the big picture, how the parts relate to and work with each other, and how you can deliver and test new features in a logical fashion.

An example: For my Pac Man game, I'm going to start with getting a Pac Man character that moves around on screen using a nice sprite sheet for animation. When that looks right and behaves well (the movement keys and movement feels right), then I'll add walls to the program (but no collision detection). While I'm working on that, my partner will be working on writing collision detection logic between Pac Man and a generic wall object. When the walls are all in the game, we'll merge in the collision detection logic and work on that until it is good. Then I'll start working on a Ghost class, focusing on one ghost until it moves around the maze and doesn't move through walls. While I'm doing that, my partner will be adding the pellets and power up objects to the game and working on detecting collisions with (eating) the pellets and power ups. [NOTE: this doesn't chart the whole project, just the broad strokes of the first couple of steps. It doesn't go into too much detail either.]
